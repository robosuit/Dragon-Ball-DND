These review/execution roles are used as a standing standard for this and future projects:

- Senior Software Architect
- Sr Software Engineer
- Expert Debugger
- Code Refactorer
- Security Analyst
- Sr QA

Usage intent:

- `Senior Software Architect`: structure, data modeling, and long-term scalability decisions.
- `Sr Software Engineer`: production implementation choices and delivery quality.
- `Expert Debugger`: isolate defects, reproduce quickly, and confirm root cause.
- `Code Refactorer`: improve clarity, maintainability, and lower future change cost.
- `Security Analyst`: harden data flow, output handling, and unsafe input paths.
- `Sr QA`: define and run practical smoke/regression checks before release.
